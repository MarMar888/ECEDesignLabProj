Notebook Outline: pre_processing.ipynb

1. Introduction
   - Notebook appears to be a data preprocessing script for 3D printing job data
   - Contains a link to open in Google Colab

2. Data Overview
   - Dataset contains 54 columns with various fields related to 3D printing jobs
   - Key columns and their dimensions:
     * Name: String - Name of the print job
     * Subitems: String/List - Related components or parts of the main print
     * Tech Staff: String - Assigned technical staff member
     * Job Status: Categorical - Current status of the print job
     * Select Printer: Categorical - Type of printer selected for the job
     * Slicer Project File: URL - Link to the 3D model/slicer file
     * Payment Status: Categorical - Status of payment (e.g., "Pending Payment")
     * User Name: String - Name of the user requesting the print
     * Printer Requested: Categorical - Specific printer model requested
     * Print ID: Numeric - Unique identifier for the print job
     * Job Time Tracking: Time - Duration of the print job
     * Creation Log: String/Timestamp - Log of job creation and modifications
     * Archive Date: Date - When the job was archived
     * Reason for Print: String - Purpose of the print job
     * Staff Assisting: String - Staff members who assisted with the job
     * Delay Count: Numeric - Number of delays encountered
     * Print Count: Numeric - Number of times the job has been printed

3. Data Structure
   - The data appears to be in a tabular format
   - Contains both categorical and numerical data
   - Some fields contain URLs (e.g., Slicer Project File links)
   - Contains timestamps and status tracking information
   - Data types present:
     * String/Text fields
     * Categorical variables
     * Numeric values
     * Date/Time stamps
     * URLs
     * Boolean/Status indicators

4. Data Processing Features
   - Includes tracking of print jobs
   - Payment status monitoring
   - Staff assignment tracking
   - Print count and delay tracking
   - Time tracking for jobs
   - Processing dimensions:
     * Temporal: Date Added, Archive Date, Job Time Tracking
     * Financial: Payment Status, Materials Fee Status
     * Operational: Print Count, Delay Count, Job Status
     * Personnel: Tech Staff, Staff Assisting, User Name
     * Technical: Printer Selection, Slicer Project Files

5. Additional Notes
   - The dataset appears to be from a makerspace or 3D printing facility
   - Contains sensitive information (user names, payment status)
   - Includes both active and archived job records
   - Data quality considerations:
     * Some fields contain NaN values
     * Mixed data types in some columns
     * Potential for duplicate entries
     * Time-based data requires proper formatting
