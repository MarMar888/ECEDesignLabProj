    "The Design Innovation Lab has a series of 3D printers utilized by everyone from InterEGR 170 to PhD researchers. Over the years, the space has accumulated many different printers aligned with different use cases. As well, staff must maintain and help users print on these printers. This brings about two questions: (1) what are the use cases and segments of customers that use the printers, and (2) when do they need help from staff. This question can help the space effectively identify new printers to purchase, as well as when to staff more or less employees. "

    "We acquired the data directly as Marley is an employee of the Design Innovation Lab. As for data cleaning we dropped rows with null values as it would be hard to work with rows that have null values. We also dropped a duplicate column that was named ‘Print ID’ as it would skew our data analysis. We also dropped many rows that weren’t necessary to what we were trying to find. Things such as if they needed help from staff, if they had subitems, what their job status is, tracking of the print process, the materials people requested, links and IP addresses, status of the printers, if they are doing it for a course/org, instructions, material items, agreements and understanding, if any archive data was needed, print counts, payment information, username, and additional cost."

    "Our first goal is to split the customer base into four sections that use the 3D printers in different ways. The four sections will be basic undergrad, advanced undergrad, grad, and faculty. Two of these sections are already done for us within the data we have; however, splitting the undergrads into basic and advanced will require us to do clustering. Once we have these sections, we can analyze them and determine specific trends within them.\n",

    "Unfortunately, this data is not comprehensive and we will have to make some assumptions in continuing with this report. The first assumption we are making is that all Faculty/Staff are from the university. Occasionally, external groups will use the printers and get labeled as such. The second assumption is that our data thoroughly represents week-to-week trends. Since our data is only from this semester, we are only able to find week-to-week trends rather than trends by the semester."
